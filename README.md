I have been working with Java since 2003. My most recent experience has been the development of microservices using SpringBoot and other technologies such as: SpringCloud, SpringNetflix, Docker, Redis, Graylog, Message Brokers, Kafka, NodeJs and so on. Currently I'm developing a Native Cloud environment at TMobile - Netherlands.

T-Mobile Netherlands, a Mobile telecommunication company, is creating a Central Routing database which is a local version of the COIN CRDB enriched with routing, wholesale and least cost routing information. For that they are consuming and new COIN (an association of Dutch telecommunications service providers) API that delivery and broadcast data regards: tariffs changing, porting performing and others. Consuming a stream of messages from a REST API, creating a local database reference and broadcast these messages to internal T-Mobile systems is the propose of PRoPR (Porting, routing and pricing repository). PRoPR systems is building based on a Microservices architecture using Java 11, SpringBoot, Spring Cloud and Spring Netflix. Using Native Cloud patterns and hosted and supported by the AWS environment the PRoPR is now in production and I’m very satisfied to make part of this huge challenging working as a Java Developer at T-Mobile Netherlands by Agap2IT.
